Open-source monitoring system for bee hives.


## Existing simililar projects

- [Solution Bee](http://solutionbee.com/?page_id=145#1446901477438-2cf97671-d6ed)
- [Arnia Hive Scales](http://www.arnia.co.uk/hive-scales/)
- [HoneyBeeNet](https://honeybeenet.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

## What we are trying to monitor/control

- Exit/entrance rates
- Hive weight:
  - Weight over time
  - Weight of bottom hive compared to above supers
  - Weight that is bee, weight that is non-bee
- Needs to support hive health in extremely cold climates. 
- Number of bees in hive
- Temperature in different areas of the hive
- Being able to adjust/control heat
- Overall: Hive health!!
- Noticing regional trends in hive health based on surrounding land

## Equipment needed

- Scale


## Problems

- Bees weigh ~ about 0.1g and hives weight many pounds. Most scales that exist aren't good at measuring both of these things
